# Code of Conduct

FlutterKaigi is Flutter's developer conference in Japan. Starting with the event planned at this conference, users who live in web apps, desktop apps, etc., mainly mobile apps, gather together to exchange knowledge in various fields, connect with new friends and communities, work and business opportunities. The goal is to create a place where you can increase the number of people.

To achieve this goal, all participants must agree to the Code of Conduct. If an act that prioritizes the interests of an individual (example below) is observed, the person may not be able to attend the conference because he / she may not be able to achieve this goal. We ask for the cooperation of each and every one of us in order to maintain a safe environment for all.

Examples: Sales activities, recruitment activities, religious solicitations, network businesses, harassment, and other acts deemed to fall under these categories.
